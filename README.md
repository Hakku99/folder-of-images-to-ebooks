## üöÄ Installation & Usage (From Source)

These instructions explain how to run the application directly from the source code.

### Prerequisites

-   Python 3.8 or newer
-   `pip` for installing packages

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Hakku99/folder-of-images-to-ebooks.git
cd folder-of-images-to-ebooks
```

### 2. Create `requirements.txt`

Create a file named `requirements.txt` in the project's root directory and add the following lines. This file lists all the necessary libraries.

```
Pillow
ebooklib
tkinterdnd2
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Open your terminal or command prompt in the project directory and run the following command to install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the Application

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the application with this command:

```bash
python image-to-ebooks.py
```
*(This assumes your main Python script is named `image-to-ebooks.py`)*

The application's graphical user interface should now appear.

## üì¶ How to Compile Python program into an EXE File

You can bundle this application into a single standalone executable (`.exe`) for Windows, so it can be run without needing Python installed.

### 1. Install PyInstaller

If you don't already have it, install `PyInstaller`, a tool for converting Python scripts into executables:

```bash
pip install pyinstaller
```

### 2. Run the Build Command

From your terminal, in the project's root directory, run the following command:

```bash
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --name="Image to E-Books Converter" --icon=icon.ico image-to-ebooks.py
```
**Command Breakdown:**
-   `--onefile`: Bundles everything into a single executable file.
-   `--windowed`: Prevents the command-line console from appearing when the app runs.
-   `--name="Image to E-Books Converter"`: Sets the final name of your `.exe` file.
-   `--icon=icon.ico`: (Optional) If you have an icon file named `icon.ico` in the same directory, this will set it as the application's icon.

### 3. Find Your Executable

After the process completes, look for a new folder named `dist`. Your finished `Image to E-Books Converter.exe` will be inside this folder.
